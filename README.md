# Baboons simulation
This code simulates the baboons concurrent problem. 5 baboons from the north and 5 baboons from the south try to cross the rope to arrive to the other side of the mountain. The rope is shared by all of them, cannot be used by different baboon species at the same time and with no more than 3 baboons at a time.
